# 18 NoSQL: Social Network API

This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. It uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, the Mongoose ODM, and the native JavaScript `Date` object to format timestamps.

## User Story
